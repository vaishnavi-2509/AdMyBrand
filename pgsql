## AI Usage Report

Throughout this project, I leveraged AI tools at multiple stages to accelerate development, enhance design decisions, and ensure code quality. First, I used ChatGPT to help plan the overall architecture—defining the file structure, choosing technologies (Next.js App Router, TypeScript, Tailwind, Framer Motion), and drafting detailed component specifications. AI-assisted brainstorming allowed me to iterate quickly on UI/UX features like glassmorphism, scroll animations, and responsive layouts.

Next, GitHub Copilot provided in-editor code completions, scaffolding boilerplate for React components, TypeScript interfaces, and Tailwind utility classes. This significantly reduced repetitive typing, letting me focus on refining logic (e.g., the interactive pricing calculator) and aesthetics (e.g., button and card styles). For more complex animations, I consulted AI-driven examples to implement a reusable `ScrollReveal` component with Framer Motion’s hooks.

During setup and debugging—especially around Next.js image optimization warnings—I queried ChatGPT to understand best practices for `next/image` (`fill`, `sizes`, `blurDataURL`) and metadata configuration. This guidance ensured optimal performance and correct hydration. Finally, I drafted documentation (this README and the AI Usage Report) with AI assistance to clearly articulate setup steps, feature overviews, and my workflow, delivering polished materials ready for my internship submission.
